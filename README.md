I'm curious with GenAI for a while now and got curious with Rails after listening to DHH ([this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cEn_83zRFw) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTa2d3OLXhg)). I couldn't resist my temptation to build something with these two and hence learning Rails 8 to productionize an AI enabled web app.
