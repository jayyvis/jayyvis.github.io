<h3 id="startup">Curious Coder & Symmathecist</h3>

I started coding with Logo at the age of 10. I’ve used more than a dozen programming languages. I’ve written code and debugged it on paper (when I didn't own a computer), text editor, IDE. I can code alone or comfortably pair with fellow engineers. These days, with the advent of LLMs, I’m experimenting pairing with AI coding tools to shape up code much faster.

[The answer is 42. What’s the ultimate question?](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(answer)) To me, it’s the software. I view software as an extension of the human mind. It’s a medium that allows me to externalize my ideas, shape it up and bring them to life. I code to enjoy the process of creation and achieve the outcome while doing so. I remain in flow state while coding and troubleshooting a software.

[In the medium of software, I’m a Symmathecist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEQj7fy-Htg)

<h3 id="now">What am I learning in 2025 ?</h3>

Ruby, Rails, Rust:

- Got curious with Rails after listening to DHH ([this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cEn_83zRFw) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTa2d3OLXhg)). LLMs are already in my list. So, learning Rails 8 to productionize an AI enabled web app.

- It's been a while coding with a statically typed language. Rust keeps bringing back my memories of C. Rust's syntaxes having a flavour of C, Python, Javascript with modern safety nets to detect mistakes at compile time tempts me enough to get started. NoGC, sensible defaults like immutable data, safe borrowing, traits, closures, slices, vector, iterator, option, macros, blocks as expression, ... I'm in.
